# Detectors

## Tracker
The innermost part is the silicon tracker. The silicon tracker makes it possible to reconstruct trajectories of charged particles. Charged particles interact electromagnetically with the tracker and create an electric pulse. An intense magnetic field bends the trajectories of the charged particles. With the curvature of the trajectories shown by the pulses created in the tracker, it is possible to calculate the momenta of the charged particles.

## Calorimeter
Particle energies can be measured with help of the calorimeters. Electrons and photons will be stopped by the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL). Hadrons, for example protons or neutrons, will pass through the ECAL but will be stopped in the Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL). The ATLAS calorimeters are made up of two subsystems. 

The Liquid Argon (LAr) Calorimeter surrounds the ATLAS Inner Detector and measures the energy of electrons, photons and hadrons. This system is made of layers of metal which absorb high energy particles, turning them into a 'shower' of lower energy particle which ionised layers of liquid argon in-between, creating an electrical signal. To keep the argon in liquid form, the LAr calorimeter is kept at -184°C. 

The second ATLAS calorimeter is the Tile calorimeter, which surrounds the LAr and measures the energy of hadronical particles only, which may not have deposited all of their energy in the LAr. This is made of layers of steel, which generates showers of particles from incoming particles, and scintillating plastic tiles, which convert the showering particles to photons of a proportional energy, and which we can measure.

## Muon spectrometer
Only muons and very weakly interacting particles like neutrinos will pass through both the ECAL and HCAL without being stopped. Energies and momenta of muons can be determined with the muon chambers. The detection of the momentum is based on electrical pulses that muons create in the different sections of the muon chambers. Energies of muons can't be measured directly, but the energies will be determined by calculating them from the other measured quantities.

## Missing energy
Neutrinos can't be detected directly in the detector (they only interact very weakly and pass right through the detector), but the existence of them can be derived with the help of missing energy. It is possible that the total energy of the particles detected in a collision is smaller than the energy before the collision. Yet, we know that energy must be conserved. This situation indicates that something was undetected in the collision, this <b>"missing energy"</b> is assumed to be due to neutrinos created in the collision.
